            And so, without much celebration, other than brief mentions on
            television and news websites, the UK at 11pm on 31st December 2020
            stopped, in all respects, being a member of the European Union. But
            for the very late conclusion of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation
            Agreement (all 1246 pages of it) and Covid-19, the superyacht
            advisory community would have set out a clear road map for the
            relationship between the UK and the EU for the superyacht community.
            There was lots of speculation, and even now there are still
            uncertainties.
          </p>
          <h3>What do we actually know?</h3>
          <p>
            The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the Agreement) does not
            have a single mention of the words yacht, superyacht, pleasure
            vessel or recreational vessel. Not ideal and therefore we have to
            apply general law as we know it to the superyacht industry as it
            will be affected by Brexit
          </p>
          <h3>Will Contracts Change?</h3>
          <p>
            The content of contracts should not change. People who want to build
            new yachts, buy or sell second-hand yachts or indeed do anything
            which requires a contract, are still free to do so under English
            law. The reasons for choosing English law have not changed, the
            expertise of the practitioners and certainty of legal outcome
            through precedent still rank high in clientsâ€™ reasons to choose
            English law. The choice of English law or the choice of law of an EU
            member state will be respected both by the English courts or the
            courts in the EU Member states. What is absolutely certain is that
            Brexit does not affect arbitration and the enforcement of
            arbitration awards. However, the December 2020 Agreement is silent
            on what happens in respect of the enforceability of judgements of
            English courts in the EU or the courts of EU member states in the
            UK. In the past, contractual discussions about law and jurisdiction
            were often just a battle of national wills or commercial positions
            taken by individuals. The discussions were never about the
            principles of jurisdiction or enforceability. That may now change.
            However, in the European context these issues mainly arise in
            relation to old contracts, which are no longer supported by EU
            rules. With new contracts it is a different story, because parties
            can usually fall back on new global rules. So although there will be
            instability in the short term, with aggressive litigators
            challenging English jurisdiction agreements and some disputes being
            litigated in two countries at the same time, this state of affairs
            should not continue for very long. It is even possible that the EU
            will agree to treat the UK like most EFTA states where litigation is
            concerned, although it has not decided whether it will do that yet.
            The picture is an evolving one and somewhat confusing, so clients
            should seek specific legal advice on this topic, especially if their
            disputes are not going to be resolved by international arbitration.

          <h3>Can my superyacht fly the Red Ensign in the EU?</h3>
          <p>
            The UK flag is no longer a European flag. Historically it has always
            been the case that the Red Ensign, defaced or otherwise, was less
            likely to be boarded by European customs officers than other flags
            especially if the home port was London. Now, all Red Ensign flagged
            yachts are non-EU flagged. Their presence is not illegal in the EU
            and although EU Regulation 3577/92 could be invoked by individual EU
            member states to prevent non-EU flagged yachts from operating
            commercially in EU waters, no EU state has ever done so. Superyachts
            flying the Caribbean Red Ensign have chartered successfully
            unhindered in the EU for many years, apart from very short lived
            interruptions in Greece and Palma. This is unlikely to change with
            the UK now joining that fleet. What might happen is that there may
            be demands to prove the tax status of the yacht in the EU. Is the
            yacht VAT paid and in free circulation (pre-Brexit status) and
            private? Is the yacht VAT paid or VAT accounted for and in
            free-circulation and operating commercially? Or is the yacht in the
            EU under the temporary importation regime? You need to know the
            answer and provide proof.
          </p>
          <h3>Operating my superyacht commercially?</h3>
          <p>
            The principle change here is that if the superyacht owning company
            was VAT registered in the UK, but it operates principally in the EU
            you will have to move your [home] chartering VAT registration to an
            EU member state.
          </p>
          <h3>What about my crew?</h3>
          <p>
            If you have any crew that are British nationals and the yacht is
            permanently berthed in an EU port, they will be treated the same as
            any other non-EU crew. That means they will have to be stamped in
            and out of the Schengen area when they board and disembark in order
            to pause the maximum 90 days out of a rolling 180 days, that they
            are allowed to remain in the EU. As to employment law? The general
            rule is that the law most closely connected with the delivery of the
            employment will apply. If the yacht is permanently moored in the EU,
            France for example, then French employment law is likely to apply.
